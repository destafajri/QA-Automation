Singleton Design Pattern
The Singleton pattern encapsulates a shared resource within a single unique class instance. This instance arbitrates access to the resource and storage-related state information.
A class method provides the reference to this instance, so there is no need to pass the reference around. Any object that has access to the Singletonâ€™s class header can use the Singleton.

The Singleton Design Pattern can be used in the automation tests to build up easier access to page objects and facades.
Its usage can speed up the tests writing process dramatically.
